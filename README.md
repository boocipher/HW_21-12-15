# Refatored Marketing Company Landing Web Page

## What Is This Project?

This is the code for a simple landing web page that contains navigation bar that provides quick acess to different sections on the page, images, and sections with key info. The original code was provided as part of the Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin. Make sure to check them out [here](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/) 

## What Is The Objective?
My objective was to refactor the code so that it's optimized for search engines and meets accessibility standards.

**Refactoring** existing code means to improve it without changing what it does.

> **Important**: When working with someone else's code, we should all adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](https://github.com/boocipher/Horiseon_refactor/raw/master/assets/images/Horiseon_web.gif)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements will not look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. 

## Instructions

Follow the detailed instructions below if you want to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages. They were originally provided to me by Trilogy Education Services, LLC, a 2U, Inc. brand.

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!
